      1. The mote is the knotwork of homes and thorpes.<br />
      1.1. The <strong>home</strong> is the sparking, spinning, weighing sheer onehood of the allworld.<br />
      1.1.1. The <strong>lesser home</strong> is the less home that sparks in wholes and spins in halves.<br />
      1.1.1.1. The lesser <strong>elfhome</strong> bears un-one jolt.<br />
      1.1.1.2. The lesser <strong>dwarfhome</strong> bears no jolts.<br />
      1.1.2. The <strong>greater home</strong> is the great home that sparks in thirds and spins in halves.<br />
      1.1.2.1. The <strong>oshome</strong> bears two-thirds of a jolt.<br />
      1.1.2.2. The <strong>ettinhome</strong> bears un-one-thirds of a jolt.<br />
      1.2. The <strong>thorp</strong> is the strong knot of greater homes.<br />
      1.2.1. The <strong>overthorp</strong> is the thorp of oshome, oshome, ettinhome.<br />
      1.2.2. The <strong>underthorp</strong> is the thorp of oshome, ettinhome, ettinhome.<br />
      1.3. The <strong>work</strong> is the way in which the world works the home.<br />
      1.3.1. <strong>Strength</strong> works the oshome, the ettinhome, and nothing else.<br />
      1.3.2. <strong>Light</strong> works the oshome, the ettinhome, the elfhome, and nothing else.<br />
      1.3.3. <strong>Weakness</strong> works the oshome, the ettinhome, the elfhome, the dwarfhome, and nothing else.<br />
      1.3.4. <strong>Weight</strong> works every kind of home.<br />

      <p>
      2. Every mote bears its body, bone, and knot.<br />
      2.1. The body is the way in which the mote shows itself to the naked eye.<br />
      2.1.1. The <strong>fast</strong> shows spark and size and shape,<br />
      2.1.2. The <strong>flow</strong> shows spark and size and nothing else,<br />
      2.1.3. The <strong>gost</strong> shows spark and nothing else,<br />
      2.1.4. The <strong>dwolm</strong> shows nothing.<br />
      2.2. The bone is the way in which the mote bears the spark within itself.<br />
      2.2.1. The <strong>malm</strong> bears the spark in every way,<br />
      2.2.2. The <strong>root</strong> bears the spark in some way,<br />
      2.2.3. The <strong>dust</strong> bears the spark in no way.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
      3.1. The <strong>watermote</strong> is the gostly dust that knots no underthorps tightly and one elfhome loosely.<br />
      3.1. The <strong>banemote</strong> is the gostly dust that knots one underthorp tightly and one elfhome loosely.<br />
      3.2. The <strong>sunmote</strong> is the gostly dust that knots two underthorps tightly and two elfhomes loosely.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
      3.3. The <strong>stonemote</strong> is the fast malm that knots four underthorps tightly and one elfhome loosely.<br />
      3.4. The fast malm <strong>greenmote</strong> knots fifce tightly and twice loosely.<br />
      3.5. The fast root <strong>glazemote</strong> knots sixce tightly and thrice loosely.<br />

      3.11. The fast malm <strong>saltmote</strong> knots twelfce tightly and once loosely.<br />
      3.12. The fast malm <strong>waxmote</strong> knots twelfce tightly and twice loosely.<br />
      3.13. The fast malm <strong>bittermote</strong> knots fourteence tightly and thrice loosely.<br />
      3.14. The fast root <strong>flintmote</strong> knots fourteence tightly and fource loosely.<br />
      3.15. The fast dust <strong>brightmote</strong> knots sixteence tightly and fivece loosely.<br />
      3.16. The fast dust <strong>brimmote</strong> knots sixteence tightly and sixce loosely.<br />
      3.17. The gostly dust <strong>brinemote</strong> knots eighteence tightly and sevence loosely.<br />
      3.18. The gostly dust <strong>liftmote</strong> knots twenty-twice tightly and eightce loosely.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
      3.19. The fast malm <strong>ashmote</strong> knots twentice tightly and once loosely.<br />
      3.20. The fast malm <strong>limote</strong> knots twentice tightly and twice loosely.<br />
      3.26. The fast malm <strong>ironmote</strong> knots thirtice tightly and twice loosely.<br />
      3.29. The fast malm <strong>oremote</strong> knots thirty-fifce tightly and once loosely.<br />
      3.30. The fast malm <strong>brassmote</strong> knots thirty-fifce tightly and twice loosely.<br />
      3.33. The fast root <strong>attermote</strong> knots forty-twice tightly and fifce loosely.<br />
      3.35. The flowing dust <strong>stinkmote</strong> knots forty-fifce tightly and sevence loosely.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
